# Sea-Level-Predictor
Predicting Rise in Sea Level using Regression model and Python.

!! FreeCodeCamp "Data Analysis With Python" Certification Course Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze sea level data, including metrics such as year, CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level, Lower Error Bound, and NOAA Adjusted Sea Level. Through the use of a regression model, we aim to predict whether there will be a rise in sea level in 2050.
